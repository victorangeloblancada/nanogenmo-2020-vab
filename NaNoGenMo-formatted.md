Generally portrayed as a negative goal in modern works, especially in the case of the Great White Hunter. However, it was once lauded as a worthy goal of any explorer and a sign of their skill that they managed to capture a dangerous beast without killing it.

"Welcome to Youth Center - So, you've got Free-Range Children. And it's not The '50s. How are we to keep them from a life of crime? Our hero, Melody, is a Good Is Not Nice - A character is heroic in nature, but still rather intolerable. Melody's story is this: Faking sickness to avoid some obligation. What stands in Melody's way is Yasmin, a Eat The Summoner - Alice is a Sealed Evil in a Can. Bob, either because he was promised something like immortality or riches, thinks he can control her, or because he thinks Alice isn't as evil as everyone says she is, tries to free her. After a bit of hard work, and possibly some outmaneuvering of people with more common sense, Bob frees Alice. However, rather than rewarding Bob for his service or even giving him a simple thank you, Alice tosses Bob into her mouth and eats him without a second thought. The turning point happens when: Everyone is dead… except you. This is Everybody's Dead Dave. Throughout all of this, both Melody and Yasmin have to deal with Ray, a The Alleged Boss -"

The producer shook his head. "It's not working for me."

What stands in Gunnar's way is Rory, a Colonel Kilgore - Military officer gets a kick out of warfare. The turning point happens when: The cut is a basic form of continuity editing, and can be used in a variety of different ways across all types of media as a way of moving from one scene to another. This is Cut To The Index. Throughout all of this, both Gunnar and Rory have to deal with Maliah, a Lover Not A Fighter - Sometimes women go for the strongest, the bravest, the most competent badass in town, on duty at all times to rescue them from supervillains, fight off potential love rivals with extreme prejudice, and carve their face on the moon on Valentine's day. …And sometimes they just want the normal guy. Thus, the Non-Action Guy or male chick of a group will very often have the most luck with the opposite sex, and it may be their most obvious quality. This may be to make them seem manlier in lieu of their companions' capacity for violence, to take advantage of the fact that viewers will identify more with more normal characters, or merely to give the audience a good reason to root for them. If the series has an active fandom, this character is the one with the widest variety of pairings in evidence."

The producer rubbed his beard. "I think I'll pass this time."

Kimber's story is this: An Allegory Adventure is a creative work in which the characters, plot, or both parallel those in another creative work.

Our hero, Liana, is a Hero Academy - Many fictional worlds show a hero working his way to fight and stop some great evil. Sometimes they're princes or knights fighting to save a damsel in distress, maybe they're mercenaries fighting evil for a paycheck or a regular person relying strictly on his wits and luck. Either way, they were defined as heroes in their respective stories. Liana's story is this: What stands in Liana's way is Abdullah, a Very Punchable Man - A Bit Character whose only purpose is to deserve a beating and get it en masse.

What stands in Zaiden's way is Marquis, a The Omniscient Council Of Vagueness - The guys shrouded in darkness who exist mainly to comment cryptically on the plot in cutaway scenes and plot Gambits behind our backs. The turning point happens when: In a Detective Drama, any time a piece of dialogue comes along which is off-the-cuff, not followed up and unrelated to everything, you can tell it's going to be very important. If a suspect turns up late and says''Sorry I'm late, my car was stolen yesterday", the alleged car theft will be significant. If the detective remarks that the suspect has a nice keychain and the suspect says''Yeah, it's from my old fraternity," the insignia on the keychain will turn up later to reveal that the suspect and victim were in college together. Basically this happens whenever the writer can't find a neat way of dropping an important clue into an existing conversation. This is Notable Non Sequitur.

But there's a problem. The villain lives. The hero's friends in the other world are still fighting for their lives. That other world still needs saving. Nothing has been resolved. If their "other world" was another time (specifically the past), the hero may even find out that their friends all died and that the villain won. However, their original world doesn't appear to be in any danger (at least initially). The hero could stay there and live a normal life, forgetting about what happened in the other world altogether. What is their reaction to this? "Send me back!" This is Send Me Back. Throughout all of this, both Madilynn and Mariah have to deal with Analia, a Bob From Accounting - Whenever a throwaway character in a Work Com is introduced, he will often be labeled as someone from the "Accounting department", usually to serve as the straight-man for a joke. The character's name will also tend to be common and monosyllabic, such as "Bob", "Bill", "Ted", or "Steve", altogether creating an impression of a staid and two-dimensional person.``

"I heard you have a story for me," he asked.

The screenwriter played with her pen before replying, "Yes! Here it goes:"

"Welcome to The Magic Versus Technology War - Technological faction and magical faction at war. Our hero, Naomi, is a Horrifying Hero - A hero who looks scary. Naomi's story is this: Something important to the plot. What stands in Naomi's way is Romeo, a Villain Antagonist - A Villain Antagonist is when the villain and The Antagonist are the same person. This combination of roles is extremely common, to the point where the terms are often (falsely) assumed to be synonymous and used interchangeably, though probably not as much so as the inverse that often opposes this character, the Hero Protagonist. Simply put, the central character's opponent is also an established force for evil within the universe. This role is used most often in classical myths and heroic legends, since these tales are usually a story of conflict between the forces of good and evil. It's common to see these characters either cause or be personifications of real-life issues in order to fulfill the audience's desire to see these problems dealt with when this character loses to The Hero. This character's primary role, generally speaking, is to provide conflict while giving the audience reason to root for the Hero Protagonist to win that conflict. Very common in stories with Black-and-White Morality. The turning point happens when: This is Explaining The Soap. Throughout all of this, both Naomi and Romeo have to deal with Frederick, a Insufferable Imbecile - A dimwitted person who's a Jerkass."

The producer rubbed his beard. "I think I'll pass this time."

What stands in Titus's way is Christopher, a Villainous Advice Song - The villain tricks the hero into assisting their Evil Plan in song form. The turning point happens when: When characters breach internal fourth walls to go on adventures in books, films and so on. Generally they travel into one or more books or films to become part of the plot, or, at least, to observe the plot first hand. This often forms part of an allegory or metaphor for escapism, the idea that the imagination allows a reader to ‘enter' a work and subconsciously cast themselves as an observer or a main character. This is one reason why the lead characters of books are often very vaguely or loosely described, allowing the reader to assume the hero's identity as a form of role-play. This is Intrepid Fictioneer.

The turning point happens when: The situation where Evil Twin is reversed — the Evil Twin isn't pretending to be the character, but instead the character is pretending to be the Evil Twin. Never mind that the original character hasn't studied the Evil Twin's typical mannerisms, knows nothing of his background and may not have his abilities. Never mind that the Evil Twin may be wearing a mask or equivalent which the real character can't take off since it's his real face. They look alike, so it has to work, right? In fact, it works more often than it should, often stopped only by gross problems (such as the real Evil Twin walking through the door), not by the dozens of flaws in the impersonation that nobody notices. Frequently it works because the Evil Twin's Mooks are too scared of him to question his changes in behavior. This is Impersonating The Evil Twin. Throughout all of this, both Crystal and Davina have to deal with Princeton, a Child Prodigy - A genius younger than 13."
